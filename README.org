* Logo Generator
This Programm trains & uses a GAN to generate Logos.
The Data was provided here: [[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PTA24UTZcsnzXPN1gmV0_lRg3lMHqwp6][Dataset-Logo-2k]].

This project was setup with Anaconda python. `environment.yml` contains all used packages.

** Structure
Basically a GAN consists of 2 Neural Nets:
- Generator
  The Generator generates artifical images
- Discriminator
  The Discriminator classifies an given Image as Real or Artifical

** Results
I couldn't yield any good results as you can see in the given examples:
#+attr_org: :width 256px
[[./examples/1.png]]
#+attr_org: :width 256px
[[./examples/2.png]]
#+attr_org: :width 256px
[[./examples/3.png]]
#+attr_org: :width 256px
[[./examples/4.png]]
#+attr_org: :width 256px
[[./examples/5.png]]
#+attr_org: :width 256px
[[./examples/6.png]]
#+attr_org: :width 256px
[[./examples/7.png]]

I didn't investigate any further why this is the case.
